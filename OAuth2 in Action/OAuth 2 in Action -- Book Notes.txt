Chapter 2 -- The OAuth Dance
============================
- Canonical Oauth transaction steps -- Page: 49
- When the resource owner asks the client to access some protected resource on his behalf then:
	- Client redirects user agent (which the resource owner is using and is usually a browser) to authorization endpoint of the authorization server
	- Then resource owner authenticates himself to the authorization server
	- Then resource owner authorizes the client
	- Then authorization server redirects user agent to client with authorization code
	- Client sends authorization code and its own credentials to token endpoint of the authorization server
	- Authorization server sends access token to the client
	- Client sends access token to protected resource
	- Protected resource returns resource to the client
- Bearer tokens --> Which means that anyone whi carries the token has the right to use it
- There are four main actors in OAuth system:
	1. Client
	2. Resource Owner
	3. Authorization Servers
	4. Protected Resources
- OAuth access tokens (sometimes simply called tokens) are opaque to the client --> Client does need to understand the content of it
- Access tokens are not opaque to everyone in the system -- authorization server's job is to issue the token and protected resource's job is to validate the token
- OAuth scope is a representation of a set of rights at a protected resource -- represented by strings -- mechanism for limiting the access granted to the client
	- Scopes are defined by the protected resource
	- Authorization server can allow the resource owner to grant or deny particular scopes to a given client during its request
- Refresh tokens:
	- issued to the client by the authorization server
	- never sent to the protected resource
	- client uses the refresh token to request new access tokens without involving the resource owner
